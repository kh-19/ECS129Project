# ECS129Project
Project for ECS129, Winter 2022 @ UC Davis

All files can be found in the files_folder folder - the folder can be downloaded so that all input and program files are in the same location.

dna.txt is the .txt file that contains the DNA sequence being tested for this project: 

5’ TCAATGTAACGCGCTACCCGGAGCTCTGGGCCCAAATTTCATCCACT 3’

genes.py is the python program written for the project.

In this project, given a file containing a DNA sequence we must:

1. “Calculate” and return complementary strand
2. Scan original and complementary strands for longest possible gene
3. Transcribe this gene to mRNA
4. Translate the mRNA to a protein sequence
