# ECS129Project
Project for ECS129, Winter 2022 @ UC Davis

dna.txt is the .txt file that contains the DNA sequence being tested for this project: 5’ TCAATGTAACGCGCTACCCGGAGCTCTGGGCCCAAATTTCATCCACT 3’
genes.py is the python program written for the project.

In this project, given a file containing a DNA sequence we must:

1. “Calculate” and return complementary strand
2. Scan original and complementary strands for longest possible gene
3. Transcribe this gene to mRNA
4. Translate the mRNA to a protein sequence
